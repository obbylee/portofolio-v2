        My journey as a{" "}

          Software Engineer
        </span>{" "}
        has always been driven by a genuine passion for building impactful web
        systems that truly make a difference. Most recently, at{" "}
        <span className="text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400">HashField</span>, I
        had the opportunity to contribute to the development of{" "}

          inadmin.io
        </span>
        , a SaaS platform designed to streamline administrative workflows. In
        this role, I focused on crafting intuitive user experiences and ensuring
        robust underlying solutions, from designing flexible drag-and-drop form
        builders with comprehensive analytics to perfecting intricate
        multi-level approval systems.
